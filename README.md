# As a way of teaching myself python and have solved (currently) over 30 problems from the euler project. Here I give my solutions to the problems which I found more challenging. My solutions become slightly more sophisticated over time as I improve as a coder. Solutions are mostly on python 2 with a few later on solved with python 3.
